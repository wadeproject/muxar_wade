# Musical UX Smart Enhancer

`This project is currently in development`

### Description
The objective of this project is to create a system which will function as a web application that users will access from their PCs, laptops or mobile devices. This application will be able to run on any server or PaaS (e.g. `Amazon EC2`).

The end-user will have access to information and music suggestions based on their use of other musical services (e.g. `MixCloud`). The information presented will be enhanced by the MUXar application using linked data and semantic web technologies from external APIs.

The development of this application aims to serve as an example that such applications that make use of web semantics, from an academical research standpoint, can be built. At most, this application will serve as prototype or reference for commercial applications.
